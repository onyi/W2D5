        What if we don't want the padding and border to be added on top of the width, but rather be included in the total
        width
        calculation? We can accomplish this by setting the box-sizing property to border-box. Do this for the second box and
        note the results. Note how the content box has shrunken to allow room for the padding and border. NB: The default
        value
        for the box-sizing property is content-box.

        Do box elements always need a set height and width to be visible? No! Play around with adding text into the p element
        and see how it expands and shrinks to accomodate its contents.
